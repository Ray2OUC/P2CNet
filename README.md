# Deep Color Compensation for Generalized Underwater Image Enhancement
demo and pre-trained weight of P2CNet

Our work is under peer review and it will be made available soon once being accepted.

# Pre-Trained Weights
The compensation network and model weights are provided in the models and ckpt files respectively.

For the enhancement network and the model weights of CLUIE, please refer to the [CLUIE-Net](https://github.com/justwj/CLUIE-Net)

# DEMOï¼šP2CNet+CLUIE-Net
We provide the enhancement demo of using P2CNet and CLUIE-Net in demo.ipynb and test.py, which are easily to be adapted to be intergrated with most existing enhancement models or algorthms.
